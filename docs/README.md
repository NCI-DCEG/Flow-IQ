# Custom Pipeline Development
In this section, we’ll guide you through the process of transitioning from using a specific nf-core module to building a custom pipeline that runs on an HPC system (e.g., Biowulf), and then modifying that pipeline using the Flow-IQ toolkit to make it compatible with AWS HealthOmics.
	
For example, if you’ve been working with the nf-core Sarek pipeline but are particularly interested in using the Manta module within a custom workflow, we’ll show you how to extract and adapt that module into your own pipeline. From there, we’ll walk you through the steps required to make the pipeline AWS HealthOmics-compatible, allowing for seamless execution in the cloud.
