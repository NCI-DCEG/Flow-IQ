# Flow-IQ Overview

<br>

## What is Flow-IQ?

**Flow-IQ is a toolkit designed to help NIH researchers** migrate Nextflow bioinformatics workflows from the Biowulf HPC cluster to the cloud.

Key features include:
* A [searchable website](https://nci-dceg.github.io/Flow-IQ/) to find Docker images matching Biowulf environment modules, plus curated links to cloud-accessible datasets (e.g., mapping Biowulf iGenomes data to AWS Open Data).
* Guides and demos showing how to use custom and `nf-core/tools` linters to ensure pipelines are cloud-ready.
* Instructions for building custom pipelines from nf-core modules that run on both HPC and AWS.

<br>

## Where to Start?

Begin with the `docs/` folder.
The README walks you through migrating a Nextflow workflow to the cloud and provides step-by-step instructions for building a custom pipeline from an nf-core module and running it on AWS.
