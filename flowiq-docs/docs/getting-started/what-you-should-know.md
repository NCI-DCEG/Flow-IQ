# Before You Start: What You Should Know
If youâ€™re new to any of the core technologies used in Flow-IQ, here are some helpful resources:

   - **Nextflow:** [Nextflow](https://nextflow.io/docs/latest/index.html) A workflow system for creating scalable, portable, and reproducible workflows. Consider taking the Nextflow [training tutorial](https://training.nextflow.io/2.0/) to get up to speed.
   - **nf-core:** A community effort to collect a curated set of analysis pipelines built with Nextflow. Also see ["What is nf-core?"](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/getting_started/introduction).
   - **Linters:** Tools that check code for errors or non-compliance with standards. Also see this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)) on linting.
   - **Containers:** Bundles your app and its dependencies so it runs the same everywhere. Also see the [Docker Container Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/workshop/).
