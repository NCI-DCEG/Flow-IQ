# About Flow-IQ

**Flow-IQ is a toolkit designed to help NIH researchers** migrate Nextflow bioinformatics workflows from the Biowulf HPC cluster to the cloud.

Key features include:

* A [interactive toolkit](../toolkit/index.md) to find Docker images matching Biowulf environment modules, plus curated links to cloud-accessible datasets (e.g., mapping Biowulf iGenomes data to AWS Open Data).
* Guides and demos showing how to use custom and `nf-core/tools` linters to ensure pipelines are cloud-ready.
* Instructions for building custom pipelines from nf-core modules that run on both HPC and AWS.
