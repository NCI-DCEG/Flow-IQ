# Custom Pipeline Development
This section walks you through how to build a custom pipeline using an nf-core module, test it on the Biowulf HPC, and adapt it for AWS HealthOmics with Flow-IQ.

We'll follow a real-world example and explain each step, focusing on what needs to happen and why.

## Example Scenario

Suppose youâ€™re working with the nf-core **[Sarek](https://nf-co.re/sarek/3.5.1/)** pipeline and then have an idea for an analysis using one step of the pipeline.
In particular, you want to build a custom pipeline for your analysis using the **[Manta germline](https://nf-co.re/modules/manta_germline/)** module. 

This guide will show you how to:
- Extract and reuse the module
- Build a minimal pipeline around it
- Test it locally (e.g., on Biowulf HPC)
- Prepare and deploy it to AWS HealthOmics using Flow-IQ
