# Step 8: Deploy to AWS HealthOmics

This step walks you through how to deploy a workflow to [AWS HealthOmics](https://aws.amazon.com/healthomics/), focusing on setting up your containers, uploading your workflow and parameters, and running it in the cloud.

Start by visiting the AWS HealthOmics landing page:

</p>

AWS HealthOmics provides three main services:

* **Storage**
* **Workflows**
* **Analytics**

For our purposes, we‚Äôll focus on **Workflows**. Select **Create workflows** under the *Bioinformatics workflows* section:

</p>

On the next screen, the **How it works** panel outlines the four major steps to create and run a workflow:

## üì¶ Container Requirements

A key requirement for using AWS HealthOmics is that **all containers used in workflows must be stored in Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)** ‚Äî AWS‚Äôs managed Docker image service. Public registries like `quay.io` or `Docker Hub` are not supported directly.

In our case, the container required by a module is defined in `manta/germline/main.nf`:

```groovy
container "${ workflow.containerEngine == 'singularity' && !task.ext.singularity_pull_docker_container ?
  'https://depot.galaxyproject.org/singularity/manta:1.6.0--h9ee0642_1' :
  'biocontainers/manta:1.6.0--h9ee0642_1' }"
```

We also see in `nextflow.config`:

```groovy
docker.registry = 'quay.io'
```

This means we need to pull the image locally from `quay.io` and push it to a **private ECR repository** so HealthOmics can access it.

---

## Step 1: Upload the Container to Private ECR

Navigate to **Amazon ECR > Private repositories** and click **Create repository**. For the name, use something like `biocontainers/manta`.

</p>

<p float="left">
  <img src="../assets/ecr-create-private-repo.png" width="100%" />
</p>

Once created, go to the repository and click **View push commands**. This provides the full set of `docker` and `awscli` commands needed to push your image:

```bash
# Authenticate with ECR
$ aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 \
  | docker login --username AWS \
    --password-stdin 222634394918.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com

# Pull from quay.io
$ docker pull quay.io/biocontainers/manta:1.6.0--h9ee0642_1

# Tag and push to your private ECR
$ docker tag quay.io/biocontainers/manta:1.6.0--h9ee0642_1 \
  222634394918.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/biocontainers/manta:1.6.0--h9ee0642_1

$ docker push 222634394918.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/biocontainers/manta:1.6.0--h9ee0642_1
```

</p>

## Step 2: Prepare Workflow Definition and Parameters

HealthOmics requires:

* A **workflow definition** (e.g., a Nextflow script)
* A **JSON file** containing the input parameters

You already have the Nextflow pipeline; now you need to generate the corresponding parameter file.

Use the `nf-core` CLI to do this:

```bash
nf-core pipelines --create-params-file
# or
nf-core pipelines --launch
```

Both methods generate a `nf-params.json` file, which you can upload directly to HealthOmics.

---

## Step 3: Create the Workflow

Click **Create workflow** in the HealthOmics Workflows section:

<p float="left">
  <img src="../assets/healthomics-create-workflow.png" width="100%" />
</p>

In the setup wizard, provide:

* A workflow name and description
* The workflow language (e.g., Nextflow)
* Path to the script (local file or S3)
* Your parameter file (`nf-params.json`) ‚Äî recommended to avoid manual errors

You‚Äôll also be asked to define:

* Parameter types (required, optional)
* Descriptions
* Any additional custom parameters

</p>

Once configured, click **Create workflow**. You‚Äôll be returned to the dashboard and can now proceed to run the workflow.

</p>

## Step 4: Start a Run

You‚Äôre now ready to run the workflow! Click **Start run** and complete the wizard.

</p>

One important detail: **You must provide a Service Role** during this step. This role allows HealthOmics to interact with other AWS resources like S3 buckets. If you don‚Äôt have permission to create IAM roles, you‚Äôll need help from an AWS admin.

See: [Service roles for AWS HealthOmics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/omics/latest/dev/permissions-service.html)

## üìä Job Monitoring

After launching a run, HealthOmics provides tools to monitor job status, review logs, and inspect output artifacts directly through the dashboard.

## üõ†Ô∏è Automation Tip

All of these steps ‚Äî uploading containers, defining workflows, starting runs ‚Äî can be automated using the AWS CLI or SDKs. This is useful for CI/CD or scaling to many analyses.
