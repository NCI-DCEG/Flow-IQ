# Step 8: Deploy to AWS HealthOmics

This step walks through how to deploy a workflow to [AWS HealthOmics](https://aws.amazon.com/healthomics/).

Start by visiting the HealthOmics landing page:

</p>

<br>

AWS HealthOmics provides three main services:
- **Storage**
- **Workflows**
- **Analytics**

For our use case, we will focus on **Workflows**. Select **Create workflows** in the *Bioinformatics workflows* section:

</p>

On the next screen, the **How it works** panel outlines the four steps involved in creating and running a workflow:

## Container Requirements

One important consideration when using AWS HealthOmics is that **all workflow containers must be uploaded to [Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/)** ‚Äî AWS‚Äôs managed container registry (similar to Docker Hub).

In our case, we‚Äôre using modules that specify containers, Singularity images, or Conda environments. Since HealthOmics uses Docker, we need to upload the Docker container manually to a private ECR repository.

In our example, the container required by the module can be found in the `manta/germline/main.nf` script:

```groovy
process MANTA_GERMLINE {
    tag "$meta.id"
    label 'process_medium'
    label 'error_retry'

    conda "${moduleDir}/environment.yml"
    container "${ workflow.containerEngine == 'singularity' && !task.ext.singularity_pull_docker_container ?
        'https://depot.galaxyproject.org/singularity/manta:1.6.0--h9ee0642_1' :
        'biocontainers/manta:1.6.0--h9ee0642_1' }"
```

This indicates that we need the `biocontainers/manta:1.6.0--h9ee0642_1` Docker image.

We can confirm in `nextflow.config` that the image is pulled from `quay.io`, a widely used public registry:

```groovy
docker.registry = 'quay.io'
```

Since HealthOmics cannot pull directly from `quay.io`, we need to:

1. Pull the container locally from `quay.io`.
2. Push it to a **private ECR** repository.

---

<br>

## Step 1: Upload the Container to Private ECR

Navigate to **Amazon ECR > Private repositories**. You should see a screen like this:

<p float="left">
  <img src="../assets/ecr-private-registry.png" width="100%" />
</p>

<br>

Click **Create repository**, and for the name, use something like `biocontainers/manta`.

<p float="left">
  <img src="../assets/ecr-create-private-repo.png" width="100%" />
</p>

<br>

Once the repository is created, enter it and click **View push commands** to get the Docker commands needed to upload your image:

<p float="left">
  <img src="../assets/ecr-view-push-commands.png" width="100%" />
</p>

<br>

You'll need a shell environment with both `docker` and `awscli` installed. Here's an example of the push commands:

```bash
$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="EXAMPLEASIATHVQLIU"
$ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="EXAMPLED39E9YrpO6odnxZzuFnyexzVJl2ixt"
$ export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN="EXAMPLEIQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEKv//////////wEaCX..."

$ aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 \
  | docker login --username AWS \
    --password-stdin 222634394918.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com

$ docker pull quay.io/biocontainers/manta:1.6.0--h9ee0642_1

$ docker tag quay.io/biocontainers/manta:1.6.0--h9ee0642_1 \
  222634394918.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/biocontainers/manta:1.6.0--h9ee0642_1

$ docker push 222634394918.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/biocontainers/manta:1.6.0--h9ee0642_1
```

<br>

After pushing, you should see your image in the repository:

<p float="left">
  <img src="../assets/ecr-manta-pushed.png" width="100%" />
</p>

<br>

## Step 2: Prepare Workflow Definition and Parameters

HealthOmics expects:

* A workflow definition (in our case, a **Nextflow** script)
* A **JSON file** that defines input parameters and execution settings

We already have the Nextflow pipeline defined. Now we just need to create the corresponding JSON parameter file.

---

<br>

## Step 3: Create a Workflow

In this step, you‚Äôll upload your Nextflow script and JSON file to HealthOmics to define a reusable workflow.

Once created, this workflow can be used as a template for future runs.

---

<br>

## Step 4: Start a Run

You're now ready to execute the workflow!

Configure:

* Parameter values
* Run priority
* Output location
* (Optional) Run group

Then launch the run and monitor its progress via the HealthOmics dashboard.

## üõ†Ô∏è Automation Note

All of these steps can also be executed programmatically using the AWS CLI or SDKs, which is useful for scaling or integrating into CI/CD pipelines.

---

<br>

## üìä Job Monitoring

Once the workflow is running, HealthOmics provides monitoring capabilities to track job status, runtime logs, and output artifacts.
