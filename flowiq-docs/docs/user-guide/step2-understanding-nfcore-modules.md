# Step 2: Understand How nf-core Modules Work

While it might seem like you can just run:
```bash
nf-core modules install manta/germline
```
...it's not quite that simple.
nf-core modules are reusable building blocksâ€“not pipelines. You need a proper Nextflow pipeline project to plug the module into.
Without this, you'll run into errors because modules can't run on their own.
They need a pipeline "framework" to run within else you will get an error like you see below.
